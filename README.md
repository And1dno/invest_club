## Description
This project is developed by a team of second-year computer science students. The team consists of talented developers Ildar Salakhutdinov, Presnyakov Andrey, Maxim, and Davud Davudov. They have successfully created a file manager application and are currently working on building an echo server.

The file manager provides users with basic file management functionalities such as creating, deleting, and moving files and directories. It also includes features for file search and modification.

The echo server, which is currently under development, aims to establish a communication protocol where the server echoes back any message it receives from the client. This will involve socket programming and network communication concepts.

## Technologies Used
The file manager is built using Python and utilizes the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

The echo server is being developed using Python's socket module for networking capabilities.

## How to Use the File Manager
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the file_manager.py file using Python to launch the application.
3. Use the interface to navigate through files and perform desired operations.

## Future Work
The team plans to further enhance the file manager by adding more advanced file manipulation features and improving the user interface. Additionally, they aim to complete the development of the echo server and integrate it with the file manager.

Please feel free to reach out to the team for any inquiries or collaboration opportunities.
